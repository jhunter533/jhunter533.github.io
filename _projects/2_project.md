What is PID?

PID is an acronym for Proportional Integral Derivative. A key algorithm in control theory. A PID allows you slow an approach to reach a target. This algorithm has wide uses from robotics to thermostats.

You can think of a PID as representing the error between the start position and the target. By breaking this total into smaller parts following calculus principles you can gain the derivative and integral. This algorithm is highly customizable allowing fine tuning for unique problems and solutions.

For instance in my use I used PID throughout my robotics experience to increase the accuracy of approaching a target position or angle. With my implementation the robot error approaches 0 then begins to use the integral values to push it that last leg of the approach.

This algorithm can be done with several sensors depending on use. For my use I used the Vex v5 inertial sensor. It was used to reliably turn to face an absolute angle in refernence to the starting angle being 0 (though this can easily be adjusted). My implementation allowed the robot to slow down as it approached a target and turn back if the angle is overshot and parameters are tuned correctly.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
