My name is Jessica Hunter. Currently enrolled in the computer science program at New Mexico Tech. I have an interest in all things programming. Most of my current projects and research have revolved around optimization and control theory which I share a passion for.

This site serves as my personal portfolio to showcase my projects and their related skills.
