As with any beginner area project I started with simple benchmarking level projects. This primarily included MNIST and EMNIST.</p> <h3 id="mnist">MNIST</h3> <p>Starting with TensorFlow and Keras to learn basic machine learning structure. I messed around with different layer ideas to learn what works where. My first model only utilized Dense layers with dropout between them. This achieved an accuracy of []. I then created the same thing in pytorch to observe the differences in implementation.</p> <h3 id="emnist">EMNIST</h3> <p>EMNIST is similar to MNIST but it includes letters with several distribution versions. Typically there is a similar alphabet dataset people use but I struggled to gain access to it and thus pivoted to EMNIST. I modeled my original code using basic convolutions and dropout layers. The dimensions had little thought to them beyond the input and output shape. For output I used 47 as given by the EMNIST balanced. which uses 0-9 and various letters in capital and lowercase versions.</p> <p>My second try was to be more intentional. I tried to model [paper]. This utilized the following structure. Raising accuracy to []</p> <p>I still plan to furthur explore this topic after practicing these basics. I want to delve into scene-text recognition however this is very complicated as it involves teaching a network how to see text in unformatted images and then seperatley learning what that text says. To try implementing this I may break it down into smaller projects. Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page. It’s easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format. Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.</p> <p>To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
layout: page
title: project
description: a project with a background image

---
</code></pre></div></div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/3-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/5-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/5-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/5-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/5.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Caption photos easily.
